// without holding a spot, and they differ in what else they cost:
//
//   active   — scores, holds a spot, counts against the cap
//   bench    — no scoring, holds a spot, counts against the cap
//   ir       — no scoring, NO spot, still counts against the cap
//   redshirt — no scoring, NO spot, NO cap hit, costs a fee each way
//   international — a stash: playing abroad, NO spot, NO cap hit
//
// Every count and every cap sum goes through these predicates. The
// rules lived scattered as `slot !== 'ir'` and raw salary sums, which
// is exactly how redshirt silently ate a roster spot and a cap hit.
